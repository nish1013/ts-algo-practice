# TypeScript Algorithms and Problem Solving Repository

## Overview

This repository is a collection of algorithmic challenges and problem-solving exercises implemented in TypeScript. It serves as a learning hub to practice common algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques in a structured manner.

## Goals

- Strengthen understanding of **core algorithms** and **in-place operations**.
- Explore and implement **common patterns** (e.g., two pointers, sliding window, prefix/suffix arrays).
- Solve algorithmic challenges while improving TypeScript proficiency.
- Maintain clean and well-documented solutions for personal reference and growth.
